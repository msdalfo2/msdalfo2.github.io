		<h3>Across all of our work, we are innovators and a catalyst for change.</h3>
		<p>Project Bread is committed to preventing and ending hunger in Massachusetts. We provide access to food for people who are hungry today while working to break the cycle of hunger through advocacy, education, and community action.

		With the support of our partners, donors, corporate sponsors, individuals—and tens of thousands of Walkers—we work to break the cycle of hunger and poverty by devising, funding, advocating for, and facilitating solutions that change lives across the Commonwealth. As the only statewide anti-hunger organization, we listen and learn, identify needs and opportunities, and connect people, resources, and programs—in ways both tried and new.</p>
